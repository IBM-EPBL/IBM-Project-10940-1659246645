# Nutrition Assistant Application using Cloud Computing ðŸ¥—ðŸ¥¬
# MOTIVATION ðŸ™Œ
- Healthy nutrition contributes to preventing non-communicable and diet-related diseases.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
accounted for 71% of deaths worldwide each year, identifying unhealthy diets, smoking, and
lack of exercise as major risk factors for NCDs.
- Dietary assessment and monitoring are essential steps to measure dietary intake and provide
tailored advice that can improve dietary management and health.
- However, the dietary assessment methods currently used have inherent challenges including reliance on memory,
time-consuming conceptualization of portion sizes, requirement of literacy ,knowledge on foods or other time-consuming tasks.
- In this project we are going to integerate data analysis with cloud technologies which will show us accurate
assessment of dietary intake and customized feedback
- Using Nutrition API from rapidapi.com and integrating with cloud technologies could be used to measure dietary intake
or improve the measurement of dietary.
- This project helps the people to guide and maintain their nurtitional health under all circumstances.
- Project status: Active
## Work Flow of the Project
- User interacts with the Web App to Load an image.
- The image is passed to the server application, which uses Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model Service to analyze the images and Nutrition API to provide nutritional information about the analyzed Image.
- Nutritional information of the analyzed image is returned to the app for display.
